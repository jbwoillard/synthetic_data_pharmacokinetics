# synthetic_data_pharmacokinetics
Code for the paper about synthetic data in pharmacokinetics: "Leveraging Synthetic Data to Address Data Sharing Challenges in Pharmacometrics: Case Studies with Simulated and Real Data". The code is described in the html & Rmd file for tacrolimus real data and .R file for daptomycin simulated data. 
## tacrolimus real data
The 221223 file contain the code for all the algorithms and generation of plots. The 090124 is an example of avatar for k=5 and the python code for synthcity allowing to generate the tvae and ctgan files. All the 

## daptomycin simulated data
The simulation_dapto.R file contain the script to generate the simulated dapto data and the avatar data. The tvae and ct-gan data have been generated using synthcity in Python 3.8. All the simulated data are available in the repositorie as .csv with the segment _dapto_
